# RSS Reader

Fetches RSS feeds and generates a static HTML page with links from the feed.

<img width="1209" height="731" alt="Screenshot of the page generated by the RSS reader. It contains a large heading that reads 'RSS Reader' followed by the text 'Generated 9/27/2025, 2:56:17 PM'. Beneath the heading is a table of contents with links to each of the included RSS feeds: Defector, 404 Media, blog, Infrequently Noted, Adrian Roselli, HTML & CSS Tip of the Week, and samwho.dev. The first link from the Defector feed is visible just below the table of contents, linking to an article with the title It's Just Let\'s Remember Some Guys." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd77610b-178b-47fc-a776-fae00869f2e9" />

## How to Use

_Requires minimum node v22.7.0_

- Clone this repo
- Create a `feeds.txt` file in the root directory that includes a feed URL on each line (i.e. newline delimited)
- Open your terminal at the root directory and run `./main.js`
  - You might need to adjust file permissions, e.g. `chmod u+x main.js`
  - Alternatively, run `node main.js`
- Open `index.html` in your browser

### Example `feeds.txt`

```
https://adrianroselli.com/feed
https://html-css-tip-of-the-week.netlify.app/rss.xml
https://samwho.dev/rss.xml
```

## Debugging

If something isn't working as expected, you can pass a `DEBUG` env variable when running the script to generate a text file for each feed that lists the raw entries.
```
DEBUG=true ./main.js
```
